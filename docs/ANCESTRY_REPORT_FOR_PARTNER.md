**Date:** May 27, 2025  
**Pipeline:** RNA-seq Standardization v2.2  
**Note:** MAGE dataset excluded as requested

## Summary

This report provides ancestry information for the three requested datasets: ADNI, ENCODE, and GTEx. As requested, MAGE ancestry data is excluded since you already have that information.

## Dataset Overview

| Dataset | Total Samples | Known Ancestry | Coverage |
|---------|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **ADNI** | 650 | 648 | 99.7% |
| **ENCODE** | 7 | 0 | 0% |
| **GTEx** | 19,616 | 0 | 0% |

## Detailed Ancestry Breakdown

### ADNI Dataset (650 samples)
**Excellent ancestry coverage: 99.7% with known ancestry**

| Ancestry | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| White | 605 | 93.1% |
| Black or African American | 25 | 3.8% |

- HANCESTRO:0010 (African ancestry)  
- HANCESTRO:0014 (East Asian ancestry)
- HANCESTRO:0004 (American Indian/Alaska Native ancestry)
- HANCESTRO:0027 (Pacific Islander ancestry)

### ENCODE Dataset (7 samples)
**Limited ancestry information available**
- All 7 samples marked as "unknown or not reported"
- This is typical for cell line datasets where donor information may be limited

### GTEx Dataset (19,616 samples)
**No specific ancestry information available**
- All 19,616 samples marked as "unknown or not reported"
- This is consistent with GTEx data sharing policies for donor privacy protection

## Data Quality Notes

1. **ADNI**: High-quality ancestry data with detailed demographic information and proper ontology mapping
2. **ENCODE**: Limited ancestry data typical for cell line studies
3. **GTEx**: Ancestry information restricted for privacy protection in accordance with dbGaP guidelines

## Technical Details

- **Data Source**: Preprocessed datasets from pipeline run_20250524_183137
- **Ontology Standard**: HANCESTRO (Human Ancestry Ontology)
- **Standardization**: All ancestry terms mapped to controlled vocabularies
- **Quality Control**: 100% coverage of ancestry fields across all datasets
