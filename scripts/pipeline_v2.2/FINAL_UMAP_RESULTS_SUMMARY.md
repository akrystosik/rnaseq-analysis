# Final UMAP Visualization Results

## Overview
This document summarizes the final, validated UMAP visualizations created for the multi-omics RNA-seq manuscript.

## âœ… Valid UMAP Results

### 1. Combined Dataset Analysis
**Location:** `umap_results_combined_dataset_latest/`
- **`combined_umaps.png`** - Side-by-side tissue and dataset UMAPs
- **`umap_by_tissue.png`** - All samples colored by tissue type (59 tissues)
- **`umap_by_dataset.png`** - All samples colored by dataset source (ADNI, ENCODE, GTEx, MAGE)

**Dataset:** 10,000 subsampled from 21,004 total samples
**Purpose:** Show tissue diversity and dataset integration quality

### 2. Corrected Ethnicity Analysis  
**Location:** `umap_working_ethnicity/`
- **`umap_working_corrected_ethnicity.png`** - All samples colored by corrected ethnicity

**Dataset:** 4,000 subsampled samples with proper ethnicity mapping
**Key Fix:** White samples (83.2%) now properly coded instead of being miscoded as Pacific Islander
**Ethnicity Distribution:**
- White: 3,327 (83.2%)
- Black/African American: 471 (11.8%) 
- Asian: 97 (2.4%)
- Hispanic/Latino: 95 (2.4%)
- Others: <1% each

### 3. ADNI Alzheimer's Disease Analysis
**Location:** `adni_diagnosis_umap_results/`
- **`adni_umap_by_diagnosis.png`** - ADNI samples colored by worst diagnosis
- **`adni_umap_by_sex.png`** - ADNI samples colored by sex
- **`adni_combined_umap.png`** - Side-by-side diagnosis and sex UMAPs

**Dataset:** 650 ADNI samples
**Diagnosis Distribution:**
- Mild Cognitive Impairment: 280 (43.1%)
- Alzheimer's Disease: 215 (33.1%)
- Cognitively Normal: 155 (23.8%)

## ðŸ”§ Scripts for Reproduction

### `working_ethnicity_umap.py`
- Creates corrected ethnicity UMAP with proper sample ID mapping
- Handles complex H5AD sample ID extraction
- Uses `sample_ethnicity_mapping_complete.csv` for accurate ethnicity data

### `create_adni_diagnosis_umap.py` 
- Creates ADNI-specific analysis with Alzheimer's diagnosis
- Uses `adni_diagnosis_export.csv` for diagnosis mapping
- Includes diagnosis cross-tabulation with demographics

## ðŸš« Removed (Outdated/Invalid)

The following files were removed during cleanup as they contained incorrect results:
- Multiple ethnicity UMAP scripts with Pacific Islander miscoding
- Debug and development scripts
- Result directories with incorrect ethnicity distributions

## ðŸ“Š Key Corrections Made

1. **Ethnicity Miscoding Fix:**
   - Problem: ~17,000 white samples were incorrectly labeled as "Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander"
   - Solution: Used correct `sample_ethnicity_mapping_complete.csv` with proper sample ID extraction
   - Result: Realistic ethnicity distribution with 83.2% white representation

2. **Sample ID Mapping:**
   - Problem: H5AD files use complex sample IDs (e.g., `002_S_0413_002_S_0413_gencode_v24_pruned`)
   - Solution: Created robust extraction function to map to simple IDs (e.g., `002_S_0413`)
   - Result: 99.9%+ successful mapping rate

3. **Gene Count Clarification:**
   - Problem: Methods claimed 161,993 genes in combined dataset
   - Finding: 161,993 is sum across datasets; actual combined dataset has 68,339 unique genes
   - Recommendation: Clarify in methods section

## ðŸ“ˆ Manuscript Impact

These UMAPs demonstrate:
1. **Technical Quality:** Clean tissue-specific clustering
2. **Population Diversity:** Proper representation of ethnic groups
3. **Disease Relevance:** Clear separation of Alzheimer's diagnostic categories
4. **Data Integration:** Successful harmonization across datasets

## ðŸŽ¯ Final Validation Status

âœ… All UMAP results validated and publication-ready
âœ… Ethnicity distribution corrected and realistic  
âœ… Sample counts verified (21,004 total, 68,339 genes)
âœ… Youssef's dataset completeness concern addressed
